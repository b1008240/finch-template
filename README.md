# Finch HTTP Service Template

This is a template for a simple, stateless HTTP API built on top of [Finch](https://github.com/finagle/finch). It
aims to provide a simple, consistent, beginner- to intermediate-level stack, aimed at getting a small HTTP-based
service up & running quickly with some things we care about in a production system.
